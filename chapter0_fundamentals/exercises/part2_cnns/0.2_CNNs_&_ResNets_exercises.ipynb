Some modules are simple enough that they don't need any persistent attributes, and in this case you can skip the `__init__`.\n",

    "The `forward` method is called on each forward pass of the `Module`, possibly using the attributes that were set up in the `__init__`. It should take in the input, do whatever it's supposed to do, and return the result.

    "ReLU is defined as the element-wise maximum between the input and a tensor of zeros. It's one of the simplest types of **nonlinear activation functions**. These are essential because linear operations compose to make more linear operations, which is very limiting. On the other hand, the **universal approximation theorem** tells us that we can approximate any continuous function using a sufficiently large neural network, if we use nonlinear activation functions. It's worth emphasizing that the theory of the UAT and what networks look like in practice are very different - in particular, many versions of the UAT are based on a shallow but extremely wide neural network, on the other hand most of the power of modern neural networks comes from their ability to compose between layers: feeding the output of one layer into the input of another, and create increasingly expressive functions. We'll explore this idea more when we study circuits in next week's interpretability material."

    "The `torchvision` package consists of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision, and `torchvision.transforms` provides access to a suite of functions for preprocessing data. We define a transform for the MNIST data (which is applied to each image in the dataset) by composing `ToTensor` (which converts a `PIL.Image` object into a PyTorch tensor) and `Normalize` (which takes arguments for the mean and standard deviation, and performs the linear transformation `x -> (x - mean) / std`). For the latter, we use `0.1307` and `0.3081` which are the empirical mean & std of the raw data (so after this transformation, the data will have mean 0 and variance 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define our datasets using `torchvision.datasets`. The first argument tells us where to save our data to (so that when we run this in the future we won't have to re-save it), and `transform=MNIST_TRANSFORM` tells us that we should apply our previously defined `transform` to each element in our dataset. We also use `Subset` which allows us to return a slice of the dataset rather than the whole thing (because our model won't need much data to train!).\n",

    "Finally, since our dataset only allows for iteration over individual datapoints, we wrap it in `DataLoader` which enables iteration over **batches**. It also provides useful arguments like `shuffle`, which determine whether we randomize the order after each epoch. The code above demonstrates iteration over the dataset & dataloader respectively, showing how the first element in the dataloader's first batch equals the first element in the dataset (note that this wouldn't be true for the training set, because we've shuffled it).\n",

The motivation is for efficient GPU utilisation, since processor architectures are normally organised around powers of 2, and computational efficiency is often increased by having the items in each batch split across processors.

The truth is a bit more complicated, and some studies dispute whether it actually saves time, so at this point it's more of a standard convention than a hard rule which will always lead to more efficient training.\n",

While training our model, we differentiate with respect to the average loss over all samples in the batch (so a smaller batch usually means the loss is more noisy). However, if you're working with large models, then often having a batch size too large will result in a memory error. This will be relevant for models later on in the course, but for now we're working with very small models so this isn't an issue.\n",

Don't worry about the details of this function, it's not the kind of thing you'll need to know by heart.\n",

We'll discuss optimizers in more detail tomorrow, but for now it's enough to understand that the optimizer calculates the amount to update parameters by (as a function of those parameters' gradients, and sometimes other inputs), and performs this update step. The first argument passed to our optimizer is the parameters of our model (because these are the values that will be updated via gradient descent), and you can also pass keyword arguments to the optimizer which change its behaviour (e.g. the learning rate).\n",

    "\n",
    "* You'll need a dataloader for the testset, just like we did for the trainset. It doesn't matter whether you shuffle the testset or not, because we're not updating our model parameters during validation (we usually set `shuffle=False` for testsets).\n",
    "    * You can set the same batch size as for your training set (we'll discuss more optimal choices for this later in the course).\n",
    "* During the validation step, you should be measuring **accuracy**, which is defined as **the fraction of correctly classified images**.\n",
    "    * Note that (unlike loss) accuracy should only be logged after you've gone through the whole validation set. This is because your model doesn't update between computing different accuracies, so it doesn't make sense to log all of them separately.\n",
    "    * Computing accuracy is meant to be a very short operation, so you shouldn't need a progress bar.\n",
    "    * You can wrap your forward pass in `with t.inference_mode():` to make sure that your model is in inference mode during validation (i.e. gradients don't propagate)."

    "_Note, this section is light on exercises, because it actually ends up being surprisingly hard to implement convolutional and linear operations from scratch (unlike the case for linear layers).

    "A convolution is an operation which takes a kernel and slides it across the input, applying the kernel to each patch of the input. We can view it as a logical extension of the linear layer, except rather than having every output value being determined as a linear combination of every input value, we have a **prior of locality** - assuming that the input has some spatial structure, and each output value should only be determined by a small patch of the input. The kernel contains our learned weights, and we slide that kernel across our input, with each output value being computed by a sumproduct of the kernel values and the corresponding patch in the input. Note that we use all input channels when computing each output value, which means the sumproduct is over `kernel_length * in_channels` elements (or `kernel_width * kernel_height * in_channels` when, as is most often the case, we're using 2D kernels)."

    "- **Stride** - the distance the kernel moves each time it is applied.\n",
    "- **Padding** - the number of pixels we pad around the input on each side.\n",
    "- **Output channels** - the number of separate kernels of shape `(in_channels, kernel_width, kernel_height)` we apply to the input. Each separate kernel has different learned weights, and will produce a separate output channel.\n",

This becomes a particularly big problem as we build deeper networks, because there's more opportunity for the activation distribution to change over time."

The answer is that during training mode we compute a running average of our data's mean and variance, and we use this running average in inference mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we store these moving averages? We want them to be saved and loaded with the model (because we need these values in order to run our model), but we don't want to update them using gradient descent (so we don't want to use `nn.Parameter`). So instead, we use the Pytorch **buffers** feature. These are essentially tensors which are included in `model.state_dict()` (and so they're saved & loaded with the rest of the model) but not included in `model.parameters()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a buffer by calling [`self.register_buffer`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html#torch.nn.Module.register_buffer) from inside a `nn.Module`. We've initialized the necessary buffers for you in the `__init__` method below - you'll need a running mean and variance, as well as a counter for the number of batches seen (technically this isn't strictly necessary because the running mean & variance are updated using an exponential moving average so the update rule is independent of the number of previous updates, but we're doing this so our state dict matches the PyTorch implementation)."

    "Okay so we have buffers, but how can we make them behave differently in different modes - i.e. updating the running mean & variance in training mode, and using the stored values in eval mode? The answer is that we use the `training` method of the `nn.Module` class, which is a boolean attribute that gets flipped when we call `self.eval()` or `self.train()`. In the case of batch norm, your code should look like this:\n",

    "The **left branch** starts with a strided convolution which changes the number of features from `in_feats` to `out_feats`. It has all conv parameters default i.e. `kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1` except for the stride which is instead given by `first_stride`. The second convolution has all default parameters, and maps from `out_feats` to `out_feats` (meaning it's fully shape preserving).\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the **right branch** - this is meant to essentially be a skip connection, the problem is we can't just use a skip connection because the shapes might not match up (and so we couldn't add them together at the end). The left branch is fully shape preserving if and only if `first_stride == 1` and `in_feats == out_feats`. If this is true then we do set the right branch to be the identity (that's what the \"OPTIONAL\" annotation refers to), but if this isn't true then we set the right branch to be a 1x1 convolution with stride `first_stride`, zero padding, and mapping from `in_feats` to `out_feats`, followed by a batchnorm layer. This is in a sense the simplest operation we can get which matches the left branch shape, since the convolution is basically just a downsampling operation (keeping pixels based on a `::first_stride` slice across the height and width dimensions)."

    "To test your implementation, you can use the helper function `print_param_count` which prints out a stylized dataframe comparing your model's parameter count to the PyTorch implementation. Alternatively, you can use the following code to import your own `resnet34`, and inspect its architecture:\n",

    "Note - in order to copy weights from the reference model to your implementation (which we'll do after this exercise), you'll need to have all the parameters defined in the same order as they are in the reference model - in other words, the rows from the two halves of the dataframe created via `print_param_count` should perfectly match up with each other. This can be a bit fiddly to get right, especially if the names of your parameters are different to the names in the PyTorch implementation. We recommend you look at the `__init__` methods of the solution if you're stuck (since it's the order that things are defined in for the various ResNet modules which determines the order of the rows in the dataframe).\n",
    "\n",
    "This 1-to-1 weight comparison won't always be possible during model replications, for example when we replicate GPT2-Small next week we'll be defining the attention weight matrices differently (in a way that's more condusive to interpretability research). In these cases, you'll need to resort to different debugging methods, like running the models on the same input and checking they give the same output. You can also break this down into smaller steps by running individual models, and by checking the shape before checking values. However in this case we don't need to resort to that, because our implementation is equivalent to the reference model's implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a more general point, tweaking your model until all the layers match up might be a difficult and frustrating exercise at times, however it's a pretty good example of the kind of low-level model implementation and debugging that is important for your growth as ML engineers! So don't be disheartened if you find it hard to get exactly right (although we certainly recommend looking at the solutions and moving on if you're stuck on this particular exercise for more than ~45 minutes)."

    "We can see that the first discrepancy occurs at the first parameter from `residual_layers.1`, meaning something in the second `BlockGroup` in our sequential of blockgroups. We can see that the first blockgroup only had left branches but no right branches (this is because for the very first blockgroup we had `in_feats == out_feats == 64` and also `first_strides_per_group[0] == 1`, meaning this first blockgroup was shape-preserving and it didn't need a right branch). So it's the presence of a right branch that's causing the mismatch.\n",

    "Looking closer at the dataframe, we see that the left-hand parameter (from our model) has shape `(128, 64, 1, 1)` and has `right` in its name, so we deduce it's the 1x1 convolutional weight from the right branch. But the parameter from the PyTorch model has shape `(128, 64, 3, 3)`, i.e. it's a convolutional weight with a 3x3 kernel, so must be from the left branch (it also matches the naming convention for the left-branch convolutional weight from the first blockgroup - row index 3 in the dataframe). So we've now figured out what the problem is: **your implementation defines the right branch before the left branch in the the `ResidualBlock.__init__` method, and to match param orders with the PyTorch model you should swap them around.**\n",

If a parameter has its `requires_grad` attribute set to `False`, it means gradients won't be computed for this tensor during backpropagation. Thanks to PyTorch helpfully keeping track of the parameters which require gradients (using a structure called the **computational graph**), if we set `requires_grad = False` for the first few layers of parameters in our model, PyTorch will actually save us time and compute by not calculating gradients for these parameters at all.\n",

I see this as analogous to how [many CS courses](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) start by teaching you about languages like C and concepts like pointers and memory management before moving on to higher-level langauges like Python which abstract away these details. The hope is that when you get to the later sections of the course, you'll have the tools to understand them better."

Commonly, powers of 2 are chosen for computational efficiency, and deeper layers might have more channels to capture complex features.

There can be any number of output channels. In a pooling layer, the maximum operation is applied independently for each input channel, meaning the number of output channels is necessarily equal to the number of input channels."
